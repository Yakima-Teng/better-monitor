Then you can initialize BetterMonitor configuration like below:

```javascript
import BetterMonitor from 'better-monitor' // This line is unnecessary if you use HTML Script tag to include the SDK

BetterMonitor.init({
  projectId: 1,
})
```

That's all.

However, if you want to config more details, please refer to our [document on github](https://yakima-teng.github.io/better-monitor/) or [document on verybugs.com](https://www.verybugs.com/better-monitor/).
